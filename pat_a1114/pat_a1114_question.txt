1114. Family Property (25) | Programming Ability Test


This time, you are supposed to help us collect the data for family-owned property.  Given each person's family members, and the estate（房产）info under his/her own name, we need to know the size of each family, and the average area and number of sets of their real estate.


Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=1000).  Then N lines follow, each gives the infomation of a person who owns estate in the format:

ID Father Mother k Child1 ... Childk M_estate Area


where ID is a unique 4-digit identification number for each person; Father and Mother are the ID's of this person's parents (if a parent has passed away, -1 will be given instead); k (0<=k<=5) is the number of children of this person; Childi's are the ID's of his/her children; M_estate is the total number of sets of the real estate under his/her name; and Area is the total area of his/her estate.



Output Specification:


For each case, first print in a line the number of families (all the people that are related directly or indirectly are considered in the same family).  Then output the family info in the format:


ID M AVG_sets AVG_area


where ID is the smallest ID in the family; M is the total number of family members; AVG_sets is the average number of sets of their real estate; and AVG_area is the average area.  The average numbers must be accurate up to 3 decimal places.  The families must be given in descending order of their average areas, and in ascending order of the ID's if there is a tie.
