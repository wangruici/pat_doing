1046. Shortest Distance (20) | Programming Ability Test


The task is really simple: given N exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.


Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains an integer N (in [3, 105]), followed by N integer distances D1 D2 ... DN, where Di is the distance between the i-th and the (i+1)-st exits, and DN is between the N-th and the 1st exits.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.  The second line gives a positive integer M (<=104), with M lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to N.  It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 107.


Output Specification:


For each test case, print your results in M lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.
