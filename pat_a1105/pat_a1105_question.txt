1105. Spiral Matrix (25) | Programming Ability Test

This time your job is to fill a sequence of N positive integers into a spiral matrix in non-increasing order.  A spiral matrix is filled in from the first element at the upper-left corner, then move in a clockwise spiral.  The matrix has m rows and n columns, where m and n satisfy the following: m*n must be equal to N; m>=n; and m-n is the minimum of all the possible values.


Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N.  Then the next line contains N positive integers to be filled into the spiral matrix.  All the numbers are no more than 104.  The numbers in a line are separated by spaces.


Output Specification:

For each test case, output the resulting matrix in m lines, each contains n numbers.  There must be exactly 1 space between two adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the end of each line.

Sample Input:
12
37 76 20 98 76 42 53 95 60 81 58 93

Sample Output:
98 95 93
42 37 81
53 20 76
58 60 76
