Given a list of N student records with name, ID and grade. You are supposed to sort the records with respect to the grade in non-increasing order, 
and output those student records of which the grades are in a given interval.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case is given in the following format:

N
name[1] ID[1] grade[1]
name[2] ID[2] grade[2]
... ...
name[N] ID[N] grade[N]
grade1 grade2
where name[i] and ID[i] are strings of no more than 10 characters with no space,
 grade[i] is an integer in [0, 100], grade1 and grade2 are the boundaries of the grade's interval. It is guaranteed that all the grades are distinct.

Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the student records of which the grades are in the given interval [grade1, grade2] and are in non-increasing order. 
Each student record occupies a line with the student's name and ID, separated by one space. If there is no student's grade in that interval, output "NONE" instead.
