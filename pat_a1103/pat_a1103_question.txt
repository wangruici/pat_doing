1103. Integer Factorization (30)


The K-P factorization of a positive integer N is to write N as the sum of the P-th power of K positive integers. You are supposed to write a program to find the K-P factorization of N for any positive integers N, K and P.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives in a line the three positive integers N (<=400), K (<=N) and P (1<P<=7). The numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each case, if the solution exists, output in the format:

N = n1^P + ... nK^P

where ni (i=1, ... K) is the i-th factor. All the factors must be printed in non-increasing order.

Note: the solution may not be unique. For example, the 5-2 factorization of 169 has 9 solutions, such as 122 + 42 + 22 + 22 + 12, or 112 + 62 + 22 + 22 + 22, or more. You must output the one with the maximum sum of the factors. If there is a tie, the largest factor sequence must be chosen -- sequence { a1, a2, ... aK } is said to be larger than { b1, b2, ... bK } if there exists 1<=L<=K such that ai=bi for i<L and aL>bL

If there is no solution, simple output "Impossible".
Sample Input 1:

169 5 2

Sample Output 1:

169 = 6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 5^2

Sample Input 2:

169 167 3

Sample Output 2:

Impossible
