1065. A+B and C (64bit) (20) | Programming Ability Test

Given three integers A, B and C in [-263, 263], you are supposed to tell whether A+B > C.


Input Specification:


The first line of the input gives the positive number of test cases, T (<=10).  Then T test cases follow, each consists of a single line containing three integers A, B and C, separated by single spaces.


Output Specification:


For each test case, output in one line "Case #X: true" if A+B&gtC;, or "Case #X: false" otherwise, where X is the case number (starting from 1). 


Sample Input:
3
1 2 3
2 3 4
9223372036854775807 -9223372036854775808 0
