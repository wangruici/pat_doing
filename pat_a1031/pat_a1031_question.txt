1031. Hello World for U (20) | Programming Ability Test

Given any string of N (>=5) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of U.  For example, "helloworld" can be printed as:
h  d
e  l
l  r
lowo


That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical line with n1 characters, then left to right along the bottom line with n2 characters, and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with n3 characters.  And more, we would like U to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that n1 = n3 = max { k| k <= n2 for all 3 <= n2 <= N } with n1 + n2 + n3 - 2 = N.


Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line.  The string contains no white space.


Output Specification:


For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.
Sample Input:
helloworld!

Sample Output:
h   !
e   d
l   l
lowor
