1094. The Largest Generation (25) | Programming Ability Test


A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree where all the nodes on the same level belong to the same generation.  Your task is to find the generation with the largest population.


Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  Each case starts with two positive integers N (&lt100;) which is the total number of family members in the tree (and hence assume that all the members are numbered from 01 to N), and M (&ltN;) which is the number of family members who have children.  Then M lines follow, each contains the information of a family member in the following format:


ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]


where ID is a two-digit number representing a family member, K (&gt0;) is the number of his/her children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of his/her children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.


Output Specification:


For each test case, print in one line the largest population number and the level of the corresponding generation.  It is assumed that such a generation is unique, and the root level is defined to be 1.  
Sample Input:
23 13
21 1 23
01 4 03 02 04 05
03 3 06 07 08

11 2 19 20
17 1 22
05 1 11
07 1 14
09 1 17
10 1 18

Sample Output:
