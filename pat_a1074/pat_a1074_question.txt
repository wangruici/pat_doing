1074. Reversing Linked List (25)


Given a constant K and a singly linked list L, you are supposed to reverse the links of every K elements on L. For example, given L being 1→2→3→4→5→6, if K = 3, then you must output 3→2→1→6→5→4; if K = 4, you must output 4→3→2→1→5→6.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains the address of the first node, a positive N (<= 105) which is the total number of nodes, and a positive K (<=N) which is the length of the sublist to be reversed. The address of a node is a 5-digit nonnegative integer, and NULL is represented by -1.

Then N lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

Address Data Next

where Address is the position of the node, Data is an integer, and Next is the position of the next node.

Output Specification:

For each case, output the resulting ordered linked list. Each node occupies a line, and is printed in the same format as in the input.
Sample Input:

00100 6 4
00000 4 99999
00100 1 12309
68237 6 -1
33218 3 00000
99999 5 68237
12309 2 33218

Sample Output:

00000 4 33218
33218 3 12309
12309 2 00100
00100 1 99999
99999 5 68237
68237 6 -1
