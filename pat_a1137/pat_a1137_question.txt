1137. Final Grading (25) | Programming Ability Test

For a student taking the online course "Data Structures" on China University MOOC (http://www.icourse163.org/), to be qualified for a certificate, he/she must first obtain no less than 200 points from the online programming assignments, and then receive a final grade no less than 60 out of 100.  The final grade is calculated by G = (Gmid-termx 40% + Gfinalx 60%) if Gmid-term > Gfinal, or Gfinal will be taken as the final grade G.  Here Gmid-term and Gfinal are the student's scores of the mid-term and the final exams, respectively.


The problem is that different exams have different grading sheets.  Your job is to write a program to merge all the grading sheets into one.



Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives three positive integers: P , the number of students having done the online programming assignments; M, the number of students on the mid-term list; and N, the number of students on the final exam list.  All the numbers are no more than 10,000.
Then three blocks follow.  The first block contains P online programming scores Gp's; the second one contains M mid-term scores Gmid-term's; and the last one contains N final exam scores Gfinal's.  Each score occupies a line with the format: StudentID Score, where StudentID is a string of no more than 20 English letters and digits, and Score is a nonnegative integer (the maximum score of the online programming is 900, and that of the mid-term and final exams is 100).


Output Specification:


For each case, print the list of students who are qualified for certificates.  Each student occupies a line with the format:


StudentID Gp Gmid-term Gfinal G



If some score does not exist, output "-1" instead. The output must be sorted in descending order of their final grades (G must be rounded up to an integer).  If there is a tie, output in ascending order of their StudentID's.  It is guaranteed that the StudentID's are all distinct, and there is at least one qualified student.
