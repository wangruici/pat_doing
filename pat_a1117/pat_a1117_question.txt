1117. Eddington Number(25) | Programming Ability Test


British astronomer Eddington liked to ride a bike.  It is said that in order to show off his skill, he has even defined an "Eddington number", E -- that is, the maximum integer E such that it is for E days that one rides more than E miles.  Eddington's own E was 87.


Now given everyday's distances that one rides for N days, you are supposed to find the corresponding E (<=N).



Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N(<=105), the days of continuous riding.  Then N non-negative integers are given in the next line, being the riding distances of everyday.


Output Specification:


For each case, print in a line the Eddington number for these N days.

Sample Input:
10
6 7 6 9 3 10 8 2 7 8

Sample Output:
6
