1146. Topological Order (25) | Programming Ability Test


This is a problem given in the Graduate Entrance Exam in 2018: Which of the following is NOT a topological order obtained from the given directed graph?  Now you are supposed to write a program to test each of the options.




Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives two positive integers N (<= 1,000), the number of vertices in the graph, and M (<= 10,000), the number of directed edges.  Then M lines follow, each gives the start and the end vertices of an edge.  The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.  After the graph, there is another positive integer K (<= 100).  Then K lines of query follow, each gives a permutation of all the vertices.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.



Output Specification:


Print in a line all the indices of queries which correspond to "NOT a topological order".  The indices start from zero.  All the numbers are separated by a space, and there must no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.  It is graranteed that there is at least one answer.
