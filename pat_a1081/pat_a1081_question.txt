1081. Rational Sum (20) | Programming Ability Test



Given N rational numbers in the form "numerator/denominator", you are supposed to calculate their sum.


Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a positive integer N (<=100), followed in the next line N rational numbers "a1/b1 a2/b2 ..." where all the numerators and denominators are in the range of "long int".  If there is a negative number, then the sign must appear in front of the numerator.


Output Specification:


For each test case, output the sum in the simplest form "integer numerator/denominator" where "integer" is the integer part of the sum, "numerator" < "denominator", and the numerator and the denominator have no common factor.  You must output only the fractional part if the integer part is 0.
Sample Input 1:
5
2/5 4/15 1/30 -2/60 8/3

Sample Output 1:
3 1/3

Sample Input 2:
2
4/3 2/3

Sample Output 2:
2

Sample Input 3:
3
1/3 -1/6 1/8

Sample Output 3:
7/24
