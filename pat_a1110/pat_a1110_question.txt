1110. Complete Binary Tree (25) | Programming Ability Test


Given a tree, you are supposed to tell if it is a complete binary tree.


Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=20) which is the total number of nodes in the tree -- and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.  Then N lines follow, each corresponds to a node, and gives the indices of the left and right children of the node.  If the child does not exist, a "-" will be put at the position.  Any pair of children are separated by a space.


Output Specification:


For each case, print in one line "YES" and the index of the last node if the tree is a complete binary tree, or "NO" and the index of the root if not.  There must be exactly one space separating the word and the number.
