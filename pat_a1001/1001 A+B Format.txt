Calculate a + b and output the sum in standard format 
-- that is, the digits must be separated into groups of three by commas 
(unless there are less than four digits).

Input:
Each input file contains one test case. 
Each case contains a pair of integers a and b where -1000000 <= a, b <= 1000000. 
The numbers are separated by a space.

Output:
For each test case, you should output the sum of a and b in one line. 
The sum must be written in the standard format.
