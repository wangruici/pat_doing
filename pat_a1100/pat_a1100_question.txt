1100. Mars Numbers (20) | Programming Ability Test


People on Mars count their numbers with base 13:

 Zero on Earth is called "tret" on Mars.
 The numbers 1 to 12 on Earch is called "jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jly, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec" on Mars, respectively.
 For the next higher digit, Mars people name the 12 numbers as "tam, hel, maa, huh, tou, kes, hei, elo, syy, lok, mer, jou", respectively.


For examples, the number 29 on Earth is called "hel mar" on Mars; and "elo nov" on Mars corresponds to 115 on Earth.  In order to help communication between people from these two planets, you are supposed to write a program for mutual translation between Earth and Mars number systems.
