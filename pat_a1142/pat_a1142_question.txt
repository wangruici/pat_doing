1142. Maximal Clique (25) | Programming Ability Test

A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent.  A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex.  (Quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory))



Now it is your job to judge if a given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique.



Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives two positive integers Nv (<= 200), the number of vertices in the graph, and Ne, the number of undirected edges.  Then Ne lines follow, each gives a pair of vertices of an edge.  The vertices are numbered from 1 to Nv.  

After the graph, there is another positive integer M (<= 100).  Then M lines of query follow, each first gives a positive number K (<= Nv), then followed by a sequence of K distinct vertices.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.



Output Specification:

For each of the M queries, print in a line "Yes" if the given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique; or if it is a clique but not a maximal clique, print "Not Maximal"; or if it is not a clique at all, print "Not a Clique".
