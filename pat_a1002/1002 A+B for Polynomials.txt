This time, you are supposed to find A+B where A and B are two polynomials.


Input£º
Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line 
contains the information of a polynomial: K N1 aN1 N2 aN2 ... NK aNK,
 where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial,
 Ni and aNi (i=1, 2, ..., K) are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. 
It is given that 1 <= K <= 10£¬0 <= NK < ... < N2 < N1 <=1000.

Output:
For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, 
with the same format as the input. 
Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. 
Please be accurate to 1 decimal place.
