1147. Heaps (30) | Programming Ability Test

In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree. (Quoted from Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure))



Your job is to tell if a given complete binary tree is a heap.



Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: M (<= 100), the number of trees to be tested; and N (1 < N <= 1000), the number of keys in each tree, respectively.  Then M lines follow, each contains N distinct integer keys (all in the range of int), which gives the level order traversal sequence of a complete binary tree.



Output Specification:


For each given tree, print in a line "Max Heap" if it is a max heap, or "Min Heap" for a min heap, or "Not Heap" if it is not a heap at all.  Then in the next line print the tree's postorder traversal sequence.  All the numbers are separated by a space, and there must no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.
Sample Input:
3 8
98 72 86 60 65 12 23 50
8 38 25 58 52 82 70 60
10 28 15 12 34 9 8 56

Sample Output:
Max Heap
50 60 65 72 12 23 86 98
Min Heap
60 58 52 38 82 70 25 8
Not Heap
56 12 34 28 9 8 15 10
