1136. A Delayed Palindrome (20) | Programming Ability Test

Consider a positive integer N written in standard notation with k+1 digits ai as ak...a1a0 with 0 <= ai < 10 for all i and ak > 0. Then N is palindromic if and only if ai = ak-i for all i. Zero is written 0 and is also palindromic by definition.


Non-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic ones via a series of operations. First, the non-palindromic number is reversed and the result is added to the original number. If the result is not a palindromic number, this is repeated until it gives a palindromic number. Such number is called a delayed palindrome. (Quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number)



Given any positive integer, you are supposed to find its paired palindromic number.



Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer no more than 1000 digits.


Output Specification:


For each test case, print line by line the process of finding the palindromic number.  The format of each line is the following:
A + B = C



where A is the original number, B is the reversed A, and C is their sum.  A starts being the input number, and this process ends until C becomes a palindromic number -- in this case we print in the last line "C is a palindromic number."; or if a palindromic number cannot be found in 10 iterations, print "Not found in 10 iterations." instead.

Sample Input 1:
97152

Sample Output 1:
97152 + 25179 = 122331
122331 + 133221 = 255552
255552 is a palindromic number.

Sample Input 2:
196

Sample Output 2:
196 + 691 = 887
887 + 788 = 1675
1675 + 5761 = 7436
7436 + 6347 = 13783
13783 + 38731 = 52514
52514 + 41525 = 94039
94039 + 93049 = 187088
187088 + 880781 = 1067869
1067869 + 9687601 = 10755470
10755470 + 07455701 = 18211171
Not found in 10 iterations.
