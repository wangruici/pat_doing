1122. Hamiltonian Cycle (25) | Programming Ability Test


The "Hamilton cycle problem" is to find a simple cycle that contains every vertex in a graph.  Such a cycle is called a "Hamiltonian cycle".


In this problem, you are supposed to tell if a given cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle.



Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers N (2< N <= 200), the number of vertices, and M, the number of edges in an undirected graph.  Then M lines follow, each describes an edge in the format "Vertex1 Vertex2", where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N.  The next line gives a positive integer K which is the number of queries, followed by K lines of queries, each in the format:

n V1 V2 ... Vn


where n is the number of vertices in the list, and Vi's are the vertices on a path.



Output Specification:


For each query, print in a line "YES" if the path does form a Hamiltonian cycle, or "NO" if not.
