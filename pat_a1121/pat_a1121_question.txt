1121. Damn Single (25) | Programming Ability Test


"Damn Single (单身狗)" is the Chinese nickname for someone who is being single.  You are supposed to find those who are alone in a big party, so they can be taken care of.


Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=50000), the total number of couples.  Then N lines of the couples follow, each gives a couple of ID's which are 5-digit numbers (i.e. from 00000 to 99999).  After the list of couples, there is a positive integer M (<=10000) followed by M ID's of the party guests.  The numbers are separated by spaces.  It is guaranteed that nobody is having bigamous marriage (重婚) or dangling with more than one companion.


Output Specification:


First print in a line the total number of lonely guests.  Then in the next line, print their ID's in increasing order.  The numbers must be separated by exactly 1 space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.
