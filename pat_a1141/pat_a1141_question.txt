1141. PAT Ranking of Institutions (25) | Programming Ability Test


After each PAT, the PAT Center will announce the ranking of institutions based on their students' performances.  Now you are asked to generate the ranklist.



Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=105), which is the number of testees.  Then N lines follow, each gives the information of a testee in the following format:


ID Score School



where "ID" is a string of 6 characters with the first one representing the test level: "B" stands for the basic level, "A" the advanced level and "T" the top level;  "Score" is an integer in [0, 100]; and "School" is the institution code which is a string of no more than 6 English letters (case insensitive).  Note: it is guaranteed that "ID" is unique for each testee.



Output Specification:


For each case, first print in a line the total number of institutions.  Then output the ranklist of institutions in nondecreasing order of their ranks in the following format:


Rank School TWS Ns


where "Rank" is the rank (start from 1) of the institution; "School" is the institution code (all in lower case);  "TWS" is the total weighted score which is defined to be the integer part of "ScoreB/1.5 + ScoreA + ScoreT*1.5", where "ScoreX" is the total score of the testees belong to this institution on level X; and "Ns" is the total number of testees who belong to this institution.



The institutions are ranked according to their TWS.  If there is a tie, the institutions are supposed to have the same rank, and they shall be printed in ascending order of Ns.  If there is still a tie, they shall be printed in alphabetical order of their codes.
