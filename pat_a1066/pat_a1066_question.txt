1066. Root of AVL Tree (25) | Programming Ability Test


An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.  In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.  Figures 1-4 illustrate the rotation rules.
    

    

Now given a sequence of insertions, you are supposed to tell the root of the resulting AVL tree.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (<=20) which is the total number of keys to be inserted. Then N distinct integer keys are given in the next line. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print ythe root of the resulting AVL tree in one line.
Sample Input 1:

5
88 70 61 96 120

Sample Output 1:

70

Sample Input 2:

7
88 70 61 96 120 90 65

Sample Output 2:

88
