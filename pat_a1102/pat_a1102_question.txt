1102. Invert a Binary Tree (25) | Programming Ability Test


The following is from Max Howell @twitter:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can't invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

Now it's your turn to prove that YOU CAN invert a binary tree!


Input Specification:


Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=10) which is the total number of nodes in the tree -- and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1. Then N lines follow, each corresponds to a node from 0 to N-1, and gives the indices of the left and right children of the node. If the child does not exist, a "-" will be put at the position. Any pair of children are separated by a space.


Output Specification:


For each test case, print in the first line the level-order, and then in the second line the in-order traversal sequences of the inverted tree. There must be exactly one space between any adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the end of the line.
Sample Input:
8
1 -

0 -
2 7

4 6

Sample Output:
3 7 2 6 4 0 5 1
6 5 7 4 3 2 0 1
